        <p>Welcome to my portfolio and collection of repositories! My name is {{UC.user.data.name}} and I am a software engineer
            in {{UC.user.data.location}}. In March 2018, I began working as Customer Support Technology Representative at <a id=newLink href="https://kipsu.com/about-us/" target="_blank">Kipsu</a>.</p>
        <p>I graduated with a certificate from Prime Digital Academy's Full Stack Software Engineering program in December 2017.
            I began my work on GitHub on {{UC.user.data.created_at | date : longDate}} and poked around until I began at
            Prime. Since then, I have created {{UC.user.data.total_private_repos}} private repositories and {{UC.user.data.public_repos}}
            public repositories.</p>
        <p>Keep up with my work here and contact me at your convenience via email at <a id=newLink href="mailto:marshcooke1@gmail.com"
                target="_blank">marshcooke1@gmail.com</a>. Check back intermittently for more updates!</p>
